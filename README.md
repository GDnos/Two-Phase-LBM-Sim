This is a simulation of an order parameter (Phi) evolving on a 100x100 lattice according to the Cahn-Hilliard equation in a coupled equation with the 
lattice-boltzmann formulation of Navier-Stokes.  The result replicates the dynamics of a binary fluid mixture. "output.mp4" shows the latest 
run of the system, set with the initial conditions for nucleation. When compiled and run properly the code will produce png frames at regular 
intervals and automatically produce an mp4 to view the results.
